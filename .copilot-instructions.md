# Calculator Project AI Instructions 🤖

Hey AI friend! Here's what you need to know about this project:

## The Rules (Keep It Simple!)

1. **Explain Like I'm 5** - Every feature needs a simple explanation first, then the tech details
2. **One File Per Thing** - Don't create tons of files. Keep the repo minimal and clean
3. **Feature Tracker is King** - When you add something new, update the Feature Tracker table in README
4. **Fun + Short Docs** - No boring walls of text. Make it engaging!

## Architecture Philosophy

- **Simple outside, sophisticated inside** - Like a fancy sports car with an easy steering wheel
- **Calculator class** = our brain, each method = a skill
- **Safety first** - Division by zero? Not on our watch!

## When Adding New Features

1. Write the code
2. Add tests
3. Update the Feature Tracker table with:
   - Simple explanation (5-year-old friendly)
   - Tech details (for the nerds)
   - Mark it ✅ Done
4. Update the architecture diagram if needed

## Code Style

- Clear function names (no cryptic abbreviations)
- Docstrings on everything
- Comments that explain *why*, not *what*
- Tests for every feature

That's it! Keep it simple, keep it fun, keep it minimal. 🚀
