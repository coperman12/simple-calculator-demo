# .gitignore - Keeps the messy stuff out of Git! 🧹

# Why do we need this?
# Git tracks every file by default. But some files are temporary, personal, 
# or machine-generated - we don't want to share those with the team!
# Think of it like: "Don't pack your dirty laundry when visiting friends"

# === Python Mess ===
# When Python runs, it creates compiled files (.pyc) and cache folders
# These are like rough drafts - we only want the final code in Git
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]

*.so

# === Virtual Environments ===
# Each developer has their own setup - don't share the whole toolbox!
