# Allure Test Reporting 🎯

## What is Allure? (Simple Version)

Imagine test reports like photos vs movies:
- **pytest-html**: Takes a snapshot photo 📸 of your tests right now
- **Allure**: Records a movie 🎬 showing how your tests change over time!

Allure is an **enterprise-level test reporting framework** used by companies like Google, Microsoft, and Netflix to track test quality over time.

## Why Allure? (For This Demo Project)

This calculator demonstrates **well-architected software**:
- 🎯 **Simple outside**: Just 5 basic math operations
- 🚀 **Sophisticated inside**: Enterprise-grade testing infrastructure

Allure shows professional practices:
- 📊 Track test trends over time
- 🔍 Detect flaky tests (unstable tests)
- ⏱️ Monitor test performance
- 🎨 Beautiful visual reports

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 2. Run Tests with Allure
```bash
pytest --alluredir=allure-results
```

### 3. Generate and View Report (Allure 3)
```bash
# Generate report
npx allure generate allure-results

# Open in browser
npx allure open allure-report
```

Or use the one-liner:
```bash
npx allure run -- pytest
```

A browser will open with your beautiful test report! 🎉

## Allure 3 Commands Cheat Sheet

```bash
# Run tests and generate report in one command
npx allure run -- pytest

# Generate report from existing results
npx allure generate allure-results

# Open the generated report
npx allure open allure-report

# Watch mode - live updates as tests run
npx allure watch allure-results
```

## Configuration (Optional)

Allure 3 can use a config file (`allurerc.mjs`) but works great with CLI defaults:

```bash
# Using CLI flags (recommended for CI)
npx allure generate allure-results --output allure-report --name "My Tests"

# Or with config file (for local dev)
# Create allurerc.mjs - see https://github.com/allure-framework/allure3
```

## What You Get

### 📊 Overview Dashboard
```
Total Tests: 5
✅ Passed: 5
❌ Failed: 0
⏭️  Skipped: 0
⏱️  Duration: 0.15s
```

### 🎯 Test Categories
- **Calculator Operations**: All tests organized by feature
- **Severity Levels**: Critical operations marked
- **Test Status**: Visual pass/fail indicators

### ⏱️ Duration Tracking
See which tests are slow:
```
test_add:      0.001s  🟢 Fast
test_divide:   0.002s  🟢 Fast
test_multiply: 0.001s  🟢 Fast
```

### 📈 Historical Trends (After Multiple Runs)

**Success Rate Over Time**:
```
100%  ●─────●─────●─────●
 90%
 80%
      Run1  Run2  Run3  Run4
```

**Duration Trends**:
```
Test Suite Duration:
0.20s
0.15s  ●─────●─────●
0.10s
       Run1  Run2  Run3
```

## How to See Trends

Trends appear after running tests **multiple times**. Here's how:

### First Run
```bash
pytest --alluredir=allure-results
npx allure generate allure-results
```
Result: Beautiful report, but no trends yet (only 1 data point)

### Second Run (Next Day or After Code Changes)
```bash
# Preserve history
cp -r allure-report/widgets allure-results/history

# Run tests again
pytest --alluredir=allure-results

# Generate with history
npx allure generate allure-results

# Open report
npx allure open allure-report
```

Now you'll see:
- ✅ Trend graphs comparing runs
- 📊 Success rate over time
- ⏱️ Performance changes
- 🔍 Flaky test detection

## Advanced Features

### 🏷️ Test Categories

Tests are organized by feature:
```python
@allure.feature("Basic Operations")
@allure.story("Addition")
def test_add(calc):
    assert calc.add(2, 3) == 5
```

### 🚨 Severity Levels

Critical tests are marked:
```python
@allure.severity(allure.severity_level.CRITICAL)
def test_divide_by_zero(calc):
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        calc.divide(5, 0)
```

### 📝 Test Documentation

Rich descriptions in reports:
```python
@allure.description("""
Test that addition works correctly with:
- Positive numbers
- Negative numbers
- Zero
""")
def test_add(calc):
    # ...
```

### 📸 Screenshots & Attachments

Can attach files to test reports:
```python
@allure.attach("Debug info", attachment_type=allure.attachment_type.TEXT)
def test_something():
    # ...
```

## Why Both pytest-html AND Allure?

**pytest-html**: Quick, simple, instant feedback (1 command)
**Allure**: Professional, detailed, trends (uses npx)

Use **pytest-html** for quick checks during development.
Use **Allure** for demos, presentations, and tracking quality over time.

## Pro Tips

1. **Keep history between runs** to see trends
2. **Use decorators** to organize tests (@allure.feature, @allure.story)
3. **Mark critical tests** with severity levels
4. **Run regularly** to build up historical data
5. **Try watch mode** for real-time feedback: `npx allure watch allure-results`

## The Sophistication

This demonstrates **professional software engineering**:
- ✅ Enterprise tools for a simple calculator
- ✅ "Simple outside, sophisticated inside" philosophy
- ✅ Production-grade testing infrastructure
- ✅ Best practices in action

Even though we're testing basic math, we're using the same tools that test complex systems at major tech companies! 🚀
