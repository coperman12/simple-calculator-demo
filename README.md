  # Simple Calculator App

  A basic Python calculator to demonstrate simple CI/CD concepts with GitHub Actions.
</div>

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Interactive mode for user input
- Automated testing with CI/CD
- Simple and clean codebase

## How It Works (The Simple Version)

Think of the calculator like a **helper robot**. You tell it what to do (add, subtract, multiply, or divide), give it two numbers, and it gives you the answer back.

**Under the Hood**: The calculator is built using a `Calculator` class that keeps all the math operations organized in one place. Each operation is a separate method that knows exactly how to do its job. When you divide by zero, it politely stops you because that would break math!

## Architecture

Here's how the pieces fit together:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    User[You] -->|Give numbers + operation| Calculator
    Calculator -->|Returns answer| User

    subgraph CalculatorBrain[Calculator Brain]
        Add[Add Numbers]
        Subtract[Subtract Numbers]
        Multiply[Multiply Numbers]
        Divide[Divide Numbers]
        SafetyCheck[Division Safety Check]
    end

    Calculator --> CalculatorBrain
    Divide --> SafetyCheck
```

**What This Means**:
- You give the calculator two numbers and tell it what to do
- The calculator has a "brain" (the Calculator class) with different skills
- Each skill does one thing really well
- The division skill has a safety check to prevent math errors

## Quick Start

### Install Dependencies

**Using pip (traditional)**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Using uv (modern & fast)** ⚡:
```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

> **What's uv?** A super-fast Python package manager (10-100x faster than pip!). See [`docs/UV.md`](docs/UV.md) for details.

### Run the Calculator

```bash
python -m calculator.calculator
```

This will show a demo and then enter interactive mode where you can perform calculations.

### Run Tests

**Quick test** (pytest-html):
```bash
pytest
```

**Enterprise reporting** (Allure with trends):
```bash
pytest --alluredir=allure-results
allure serve allure-results
```

For more options:
```bash
pytest -v              # Verbose output
pytest --cov           # With coverage report
```

After running tests, check `reports/test-report.html` for a quick visual report!
Or use Allure for enterprise-level reporting with trends 📊

**Automated CI/CD**: Every push to `main` automatically runs tests and publishes Allure reports to GitHub Pages with history tracking!

📊 **Live Report**: https://guitaristforever.github.io/simple-calculator-demo/

See [`docs/ALLURE.md`](docs/ALLURE.md), [`docs/CI-CD.md`](docs/CI-CD.md), and [`docs/GITHUB-PAGES.md`](docs/GITHUB-PAGES.md) for details.

## Pre-commit Hooks

**Simple Explanation**: Think of pre-commit hooks as airport security for your code - they check everything before it "boards the plane" (gets committed). They catch secrets, fix formatting, and ensure quality automatically!

**Setup** (one-time):
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

**Usage**: Hooks run automatically on every commit! Or run manually:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### What's Protected

| Hook | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| 🔒 Gitleaks | Prevents committing secrets/API keys |
| 🐍 Ruff Linter | Checks Python code quality |
| 🎨 Ruff Formatter | Auto-formats Python code |
| ✂️ Whitespace | Removes trailing spaces |
| 📝 End-of-file | Ensures files end with newline |
| 📦 Import Sort | Organizes Python imports |
| 🔑 Private Keys | Detects SSH/SSL keys |
| 📦 Large Files | Prevents files >500KB |
| 🔀 Merge Conflicts | Catches conflict markers |

**Tech Details**: Pre-commit runs security checks (gitleaks), Python linting (ruff), and file validation automatically. Also runs in CI via GitHub Actions to ensure all commits are clean!

## Usage Examples

### Basic Operations

```python
from calculator import Calculator

calc = Calculator()

# Addition
result = calc.add(5, 3)        # Returns: 8

# Subtraction
result = calc.subtract(10, 4)  # Returns: 6

# Multiplication
result = calc.multiply(6, 7)   # Returns: 42

# Division
result = calc.divide(15, 3)    # Returns: 5.0
```

### Interactive Mode

When you run `python calculator.py`, you'll see:

```
Simple Calculator Demo
======================
5 + 3 = 8
10 - 4 = 6
6 * 7 = 42
15 / 3 = 5.0

Interactive Mode (type 'quit' to exit):
Enter operation (add/subtract/multiply/divide): add
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.0
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- **Automated Testing**: Runs unit tests on every push and pull request
- **Multi-Python Support**: Tests against Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11
- **Simple Workflow**: Just pushes trigger the pipeline automatically

### How It Works (Simple Version)

Think of it like a **robot assembly line**:
1. 📝 You push code to GitHub
2. 🤖 Robot wakes up and runs all tests
3. 📊 Creates a beautiful report
4. 🌐 Publishes it to the internet
5. 🔗 Gives you a link to share!
