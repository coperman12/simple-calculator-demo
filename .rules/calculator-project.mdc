# Calculator Project - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
This is a simple Python calculator project with a focus on clean architecture, minimal files, and engaging documentation.

## Core Rules

### 1. Explanation First
- Explain features in simple, beginner-friendly terms before diving into technical details
- Use analogies and clear language (explain like I'm 5)
- Follow with technical specifics for developers

### 2. Minimal File Structure
- Keep the repository clean and minimal
- Don't create unnecessary files
- One file per logical component

### 3. Feature Tracker Management
- **CRITICAL**: When adding any new feature, ALWAYS update the Feature Tracker table in README.md
- Include:
  - Simple explanation (beginner-friendly)
  - Technical details (for developers)
  - Mark as ✅ Done
- Update architecture diagrams if the change affects structure

### 4. Documentation Style
- Keep documentation fun and engaging
- Avoid walls of text
- Use clear sections and formatting
- Add emojis for visual appeal

## Architecture Philosophy

### Design Principles
- **Simple outside, sophisticated inside** - Easy to use, powerful under the hood
- **Calculator class = brain** - Each method represents a specific capability
- **Safety first** - Handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero)

### Code Structure
- Calculator class contains all calculation logic
- Each operation is a separate method
- Input validation and error handling are built-in

## Code Style Requirements

### Naming Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive function names
- Avoid cryptic abbreviations
- Make intent obvious from the name

### Documentation
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Comments should explain **why**, not **what**
- Keep docstrings concise but informative

### Testing
- Write tests for every feature
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests simple and readable

## Workflow for New Features

1. **Implement** - Write the feature code
2. **Test** - Create comprehensive tests
3. **Verify Tests** - Run tests locally (`pytest` or `tox -e fast`)
4. **Document** - Update README Feature Tracker table
5. **Verify** - Check architecture diagram needs updates
6. **Run Tests** - Execute full test suite (MANDATORY before commit)
7. **Pre-commit** - Run pre-commit hooks (see pre-commit-hook.mdc for details)
8. **Commit** - Use clear commit messages

**Note:** Steps 6-8 follow the flawless workflow defined in `.rules/pre-commit-hook.mdc`

**Critical:** Tests MUST pass before committing. Use `tox -e fast` for quick isolated testing or `pytest` for local testing.

## File Organization

Current structure:
- `src/calculator.py` - Main Calculator class
- `tests/test_calculator.py` - All tests
- `README.md` - Main documentation with Feature Tracker
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

Keep this minimal structure unless absolutely necessary to add files.

## Remember

- Keep it simple
- Keep it fun
- Keep it minimal
- Update Feature Tracker for every new capability
