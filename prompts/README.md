# Prompts Folder

This folder contains copy-paste prompts you can use in other projects to
recreate the same CI/CD best practices from this repo.

Use case:
- Grab a prompt, paste it into your AI assistant in your target repo.
- Fill in the placeholders for that repo.
- Get ready-to-apply CI/CD files and README updates.

Files:
- `ci-cd-general.md`: General prompt for any language or stack.
  - Use this if the repo is not Python-specific.
  - Good for teams with mixed tech or unknown tooling.
